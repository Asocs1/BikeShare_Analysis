### BikeShare Data Analysis

### Description
This project analyzes data from bike share systems in three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington using Python, the project explores and processes the data to answer various interesting questions. The analysis involves calculating descriptive statistics to understand patterns in the bike share usage. Additionally, an interactive script is included to allow users to input data and view customized statistics directly from the terminal.

### Files used
*  [bikeshare.py](https://github.com/Asocs1/BikeShare_Analysis/blob/master/bikeshare.py): The main Python script that contains the code for loading, processing, and analyzing the bike share data.

* Data files for Chicago, New York City, and Washington were provided as part of the Udacity course.
